# Open Tasks — Suq ERP

Last updated: 2026-06-17 (session 19, part 3)

## Offline-first (branch `offline-first`, in progress)

- [x] **Phase 1** — local Drift schema v5 (shop/branches/settings/payment
  methods/categories/units/profiles/credit_payments) + download/pull sync in
  SeedService + SyncScheduler push-then-pull on triggers + local-first
  shop/branch providers. (commits 54f5495, 77f4f46)
- [x] **Phase 2** — every read screen has an offline path: Today's Summary,
  Inventory, Customers, Expenses (+categories), Credits (list/per-customer/
  payment history), Reports (summary + drill-downs, recomputed locally),
  Settings. (commits 512bde8, 5e69eb9, 6509744)
  - Remaining polish: Sales tab offline list doesn't yet show customer/cashier
    names (Reports drill-down does).
- [x] **Phase 3** — oversell conflict system. Migration 021: `stock_conflicts`
  table + `detect_stock_conflict` trigger (records a conflict when inventory
  goes negative) + owner-only resolve RLS. Migration 022: product_id index.
  cron-notifications v3 adds a STOCK CONFLICTS digest section. App:
  conflicts_provider (stockConflictsProvider + ResolveConflictNotifier with a
  conditional-claim guard against concurrent resolves), StockConflictsScreen,
  owner-only dashboard banner (gated on owner-exclusive `settings.manage`),
  `/stock-conflicts` route. (commits baa2055, f9d4d09, aa92b11)
- [ ] **Verify offline end-to-end** on device: build APK from `offline-first`,
  confirm every screen loads offline, and force a two-device oversell conflict.
- [ ] Then merge `offline-first` -> `main`.
- [ ] Verify offline boot + every screen loads offline; keep 15-min pull.
- [x] Q1 — overdue email = all unpaid credits regardless of age (fn v6).

### Observed offline bugs (motivate the v2 refactor below)
- [ ] "Could not load payment methods" on sales screen offline (form lookup still
  reads Supabase, not local).
- [ ] "Could not load categories" on inventory add-item offline (same cause).
- [ ] Cannot settle credit offline (write is Supabase-direct).
- [ ] Credit detail shows no customer / cashier offline (join-derived fields are
  null in local path — need denormalization).
- [ ] All operations slower offline (local-fallback waits on network timeout
  instead of reading local-first).

## Offline-first v2 — absolute boundary + replica sync engine
See DECISIONS.md "Offline-first v2". Design approved 2026-06-13. Do in order.

**Code reality check (read 2026-06-14 — narrows scope; don't rebuild):**
- Outbox push ALREADY covers customers→sales→expenses→adjustments, FK-ordered,
  ALREADY idempotent (select-before-insert). `sync_service.dart`.
- Connectivity auto-trigger ALREADY exists (offline→online edge + 15-min + cold
  start). `sync_scheduler.dart`. (CURRENT_STATE tech-debt note was stale; fixed.)
- Observability infra partly exists: `sync_logs` heartbeat, `lastSyncedAt()`,
  `isSyncOverdue()`. Phase-D debug view just needs a screen.
- Confirmed broken: `getPaymentMethods` has NO local path (sales_repository.dart
  :64). `getSale`/`getSalesForBranch` are server-FIRST not local-first (:256-297)
  — same root cause as missing names (local rows lack customer/cashier/payment).
  `voidSale` (:248) + `createCustomer` (:80) are remote-first. Inline push in
  `createSale` (:217-233) duplicates SyncService — remove.
- Push is row-by-row w/ a SELECT per row (2N round trips) → batch into bulk upsert.
- Pull is full `seedAll` re-download → make delta.

**Phase A — Schema & boundary foundation (the non-negotiables)**
- [x] Migration `023_offline_sync_metadata.sql`: adds `updated_at` +
  `deleted_at` to all 16 replica tables, a server-set `set_updated_at()` trigger
  (fires on INSERT *and* UPDATE — offline-created rows get server receive-time so
  delta pull can't miss them), and a per-table `updated_at` index. Admin tables
  excluded. **APPLIED LIVE 2026-06-14 via Supabase MCP (apply_migration); verified
  all 16 tables have the columns/trigger/index.**
- [x] RLS audit done (read all CREATE-TABLE migrations): all 16 replica tables
  already have shop-scoped RLS via `is_shop_member` / `shop_id_from_branch`. No
  gaps found in code. System rows (`shop_id IS NULL` units/payment methods/expense
  cats) and same-shop profile names are intended shared data, not leaks.
  - [x] Part 1 (coverage) run live via MCP: zero replica tables without RLS. ✅
  - [ ] **MANUAL STEP (Temesgen): run Part 2 of `supabase/rls_isolation_test.sql`**
    — cross-shop isolation with two real accounts from different shops (needs a
    real authenticated session; MCP runs as postgres and bypasses RLS).
  - Security advisor (post-migration) flagged only PRE-EXISTING items, none from
    023: `detect_stock_conflict()` (trigger fn, SECURITY DEFINER) is RPC-exposed
    to anon/authenticated → revoke EXECUTE in Phase D DEFINER audit; leaked-password
    protection still off (already-tracked manual step); pg_net in public schema.
    My `set_updated_at()` is NOT security-definer and was not flagged.
- [x] UUID + idempotency confirmed already satisfied: writes use client-side
  `Uuid().v4()`; push is idempotent (select-before-insert). Converting to a single
  `upsert(onConflict:'id')` is folded into Phase B batching (removes the extra
  round trip) — no separate change needed now.
- [ ] Local Drift schema migration (DEFERRED into Phase B/C by design) — Phase A's
  server change does not alter the local schema. The local columns (store server
  `updated_at`, delta cursor) land when Phase B's pull *consumes* them, and the
  denormalized-name columns land in Phase C; both bump `schemaVersion` together
  with their `onUpgrade` steps so pilot devices migrate once, cleanly.

**Phase B — The sync engine (single Supabase boundary)** — see DECISIONS.md
"Offline-first v2 Phase B". Grounded in: `seed_service.dart`, `sync_service.dart`,
`sync_scheduler.dart`, `sales_repository.dart`, `app_database.dart`. Do in order.

- [x] **B1 — local schema v6→v7 (migrate once for B+C):** DONE.
  - `LocalSyncState (tableKey text PK, lastPulledAt datetime)` + `getPullCursor` /
    `setPullCursor`. (Column is `tableKey` not `tableName` — Drift reserves
    `tableName`.)
  - `LocalSales` gained nullable `customerName` / `cashierName` /
    `paymentMethodName` (populated in B2, consumed in Phase C).
  - `schemaVersion` 6→7 + `onUpgrade` (createTable + 3 addColumn). `.g.dart`
    regenerated. 117 tests pass; analyze clean. NOTE for B2: Drift reads
    DateTime back in local representation — send the cursor to Supabase as
    `.toUtc().toIso8601String()` so the delta `updated_at > cursor` stays correct.
- [x] **B2 — delta pull engine (rewrote `SeedService`):** DONE.
  - Shared `_deltaPull` helper centralizes the per-table cursor: fetch
    `updated_at >= cursor` (UTC ISO), upsert live rows, hard-remove `deleted_at`
    rows via generic `AppDatabase.deleteByIds(sqlTable, ids)`, advance cursor to
    max `updated_at`. The 13 thin `_seedX` methods are the registry entries.
  - First pull (null cursor) keeps the 366-day/2000-row sales+expenses window;
    delta pulls filter by `updated_at` only (catches old settlements/voids).
  - Sales pull fills `customerName/cashierName/paymentMethodName` from the joins
    (`cashier:profiles!sales_cashier_id_fkey`). Pending-skip preserved for
    sales/customers/expenses.
  - Products + payment_methods dropped the `is_active` filter so deactivation
    propagates (local reads still filter active).
  - Dropped `InventoryRemote` from the pull path; products/stock now pulled
    directly. Updated 3 `SeedService(...)` call sites (constructor is now
    `(_client, _db)`).
  - analyze clean; 119 tests pass (+ deleteByIds + cursor tests). NOTE: pull is
    not yet unit-tested end-to-end (needs a mock SupabaseClient) — deferred to B5.
- [x] **B3 — batched push (`SyncService`), remove inline push:** DONE.
  - Customers / sales(+items) / expenses now push as one bulk
    `upsert(onConflict:'id')` each (was select-before-insert, row-by-row). FK
    order preserved (customers → sales → sale_items → expenses). Bulk is
    all-or-nothing per batch (retried on failure) — noted as a pilot trade-off.
  - Stock adjustments kept per-row: `InventoryRemote.applyAdjustment` is
    delta-aware (server-side quantity composition), so it can't be a blind upsert.
  - Removed the inline fire-and-forget push from `SalesRepository.createSale`;
    the sale just stays `isSynced=false` and SyncService is the sole pusher.
  - Added a non-blocking post-sale sync nudge in `CreateSaleNotifier.submit`
    (`syncSchedulerProvider.syncNow()`) so removing the inline push doesn't
    regress online sales to the 15-min backstop. Offline it's a no-op.
  - Dropped the `CustomersRemote` dep from SyncService. analyze clean; 119 tests.
- [x] **B4 — license as a question, not synced data:** VERIFIED already-satisfied,
  no code change needed (read `license_provider.dart` + migration 019).
  - `shop_controls`/`license_keys` are NOT in the sync registry. ✅
  - `shop_controls` RLS scopes SELECT to own shop; `license_keys` is deny-all
    (no client policy); device reads only its own 3-col control row. ✅
  - Activation is the owner-only `activate_license` SECURITY DEFINER RPC. ✅
  - Status read fails open offline; entitlement never cached locally. ✅
  - Added a guardrail comment in `seed_service.dart` so the operator tables can't
    be added to the registry later. A dedicated `get_my_license_status` RPC is
    optional polish (RLS already isolates) — skipped to avoid churn + a prod
    migration for no security gain.
- [x] **B5 — tests + verify:** DONE. Extracted the delta core into pure
  `SeedService.partitionDelta` and unit-tested it: cursor advances to max
  `updated_at` (incl. over soft-deletes / no-removal tables), live/dead split,
  shared-boundary-timestamp resolution. Plus DB-layer cursor + `deleteByIds`
  tests (B1/B2) and a guardrail test asserting `SeedService` never pulls
  `license_keys`/`shop_controls`. analyze clean; 124 tests pass.
  - Deferred (needs a mock SupabaseClient harness the project lacks): end-to-end
    push/pull and pending-skip. Bulk-push idempotency is a DB-level
    `upsert(onConflict:'id')` guarantee, not unit-covered here.
  - Also addressed CodeRabbit: bounded `sync_logs` retention prune
    (`syncLogRetentionDays`, 14d) so the heartbeat log can't grow unbounded.
- [x] Auto-trigger on connectivity restored — already exists (`SyncScheduler`); B
  just repoints `onPull` at the delta pull. Optional debounced post-write nudge.

**Phase C — Close the observed bugs via the new model**
- [x] **C1 — form lookups local-first** (bugs #1, #2): `getPaymentMethods`
  (SalesRepository), `getMeasurementUnits` + `getProductCategories`
  (InventoryRepository) now read local Drift first; `getCategories`
  (ExpensesRepository) flipped from server-first to local-first. Pattern:
  non-empty local is authoritative (system rows always seeded); categories trust
  local outright (may be legitimately empty); web (`_db==null`) → remote.
  analyze clean; 125 tests.
- [x] **C2 — denormalized names in sales reads** (bug #4): `_saleFromRows` now
  maps the B2-populated `customerName`/`cashierName`/`paymentMethodName`; Sale
  model already had the fields. `getSale`/`getSalesForBranch` flipped from
  server-first to local-first (mirror holds the whole shop's sales + names as of
  last sync) — also removes their offline timeout (bug #5). Web → remote. Note:
  customerPhone + settlement method/notes aren't mirrored locally (minor offline
  degradation; name/cashier — the actual bug — now show). analyze clean; 125 tests.
- [x] **C3a — credit settlement offline** (bug #3): DONE. Local schema v8 adds
  `isSynced` to `LocalCreditPayments`. `recordCreditPayment` is now local-first
  (native): records the payment to the local queue, sums `getPaidBySale` (incl.
  the new row) to decide settlement, `markSaleSettledLocal` stamps
  `credit_settled_at` + flags the sale unsynced so the sale push re-sends it
  carrying the settlement; `_pushPendingCreditPayments` bulk-upserts the queue;
  `_saleJson` now carries `credit_settled_at`. Post-write sync nudge. Web keeps
  the online flow. DB-level test for the full flow. analyze clean; 126 tests.
  - Known edge (like stock oversell): two devices settling the same bill offline
    both record payments → possible overpayment in the ledger, both visible (no
    loss). Sale-level `credit_settlement_method` not stamped offline (recoverable
    from `credit_payments`).
- [x] **C3b — remove inline pushes + central nudge** (boundary consistency): DONE.
  Removed the fire-and-forget pushes from `InventoryRepository._queueAdjustment`,
  `ExpensesRepository.record`, `CustomersRepository.save` — SyncService is now the
  sole pusher for every write. Replaced per-call-site nudges with ONE central
  mechanism: `AppDatabase.watchHasPendingWork()` (a loop-safe Drift stream — pulled
  rows are isSynced=1 so syncing never re-arms it) drives a 2s-debounced
  `syncNow()` in `SyncScheduler`. Covers all offline writes automatically. (The
  explicit sales/credit nudges from B3/C3a remain — redundant-but-harmless; the
  watcher is now primary.) analyze clean; 126 tests.
- [x] **C3c — product writes local-first** — DEFERRED: still remote-first (see
  Bug 5 below). Recorded as a known offline gap.
- [x] **C4 — remaining server-first reads → local-first**: DONE (session 19).
  `getProducts` / `getStockLevels` (inventory), `getCustomers` (customers repo),
  `customerSalesProvider` / `customerCreditSalesProvider` / `outstandingCreditProvider`
  / `creditPaymentsProvider` (customers_provider) all flipped to local-first with
  background refresh. `getExpenses` / reports / stock-conflicts queries bounded with
  `remoteReadTimeout` so offline fails fast to local cache. 128 tests pass.

**Phase C — known limitation (RESOLVED)**
- [x] Web/online credit settlement was a non-atomic insert→read→update. FIXED by
  migration 024's `record_credit_payment` RPC (insert + recompute + settle in one
  txn under a sale-row lock, idempotent by id); both web and mobile now call it.
  Migration 026 added `p_created_at` so offline-recorded payments keep their real
  recording time on replay. (Migrations 024–027 applied to dev.)

**Phase D — Sequenced-in hardening (not blocking)**
- [ ] Indexes on local Drift: `is_synced`, `updated_at`, `shop_id`, FKs.
- [ ] First-pull pagination + on-device retention policy (don't keep all history).
- [ ] Offline JWT refresh on reconnect (don't let an expired token silently fail sync).
- [ ] Operator sync-health debug view: last sync time, pending-push count, last error.
- [ ] SQLCipher for the local cache (now holds full shop PII) — still deferred past pilot.
- [ ] Audit SECURITY DEFINER functions for dynamic SQL / search_path (injection + priv-esc).

## Session 19 — Offline bugs found in manual device testing (2026-06-17)

Diagnosed (not yet fixed). Root causes confirmed by reading the code.

- [x] **Bug 1 — Void sale offline crashes**: FIXED (commit `9a55b7f`). `voidSale()`
  now catches network/timeout exceptions and shows "Voiding a sale requires an
  internet connection." Server rejections propagate as-is.
- [ ] **Bug 2 / 3 — Void does not refresh inventory immediately (even online)**:
  After a successful online void, `ref.invalidate(stockLevelsProvider)` re-reads
  the local Drift mirror — which hasn't been updated yet (background `_refreshStock`
  runs after). User must restart to see restored stock.
  (`sales_provider.dart:334`)
- [x] **Bug 4 — New category fails offline**: FIXED (commit `9a55b7f`).
  `createProductCategory()` now writes locally first (UUID client-generated,
  `isSynced=false`). SyncService pushes when online. Web path remote-only.
- [x] **Bug 5 — Adding new product fails offline**: FIXED (commit `9a55b7f`).
  `createProduct()` now writes locally first. Unit abbreviation looked up from
  local cache. SyncService pushes categories then products (FK order). Schema
  v11 adds `isSynced` to both `LocalProducts` and `LocalProductCategories`.
- [x] **Bug 6 — Add Stock with changed price/threshold fails offline**: ALREADY
  FIXED in a prior CodeRabbit round. Screen shows a snackbar on price-update
  failure but does NOT return; stock adjustment always proceeds. Confirmed by
  reading `inventory_screen.dart:401`.
- [ ] **Bug 7 — Report "Today" shows all zeros offline**: `reportSummaryProvider`
  and `reportSalesProvider` try server first; offline, they fall to the local DB.
  The "Today" range is computed in local time (`DateTime.now()`), but the local
  DB stores sales with UTC timestamps — for EAT (UTC+3) a sale made at 10 AM
  local is stored as 07:00 UTC, and the local-time midnight boundary may not
  align. Week/Month/Year ranges are wide enough to absorb the offset; Today's
  narrow window misses it. **ROOT CAUSE FIXED** (`sync_service.dart` was pushing
  local DateTimes without `.toUtc()` → Supabase stored wrong timestamps → delta
  pull brought back wrong epoch millis → today-range excluded the sale). Commit
  `d05ee82`. Retest: make offline sale, sync, confirm sale still in Today report.

## Session 19 — Additional device testing bugs (2026-06-17)

Reported by Temesgen. Not yet diagnosed or fixed.

- [x] **Bug 8 — Login fails when offline (auth exception)**: FIXED (commit
  `16e5bb5`). Two parts: (1) `friendlyAuthError()` in `auth_provider.dart`
  classifies the sign-in failure and the login screen shows a clear "No internet
  connection…" message instead of a raw exception. (2) The router skips the
  owner/staff network lookup and routes straight to the dashboard when offline
  with a restored session — Supabase persists the session locally, so a cached
  login is usable offline with no 5s cold-start wait.
- [x] **Bug 9 — Wrong password shows raw exception**: FIXED (commit `16e5bb5`,
  same classifier). `friendlyAuthError()` maps 400 → "Incorrect email or
  password." and 429 → "Too many attempts — wait a minute, then try again."
- [x] **Bug 10 + Bug 12 — Reports remote-first. FIXED (commit `9a55b7f`).**
  `reportSummaryProvider` and `reportSalesProvider` are now local-first on native:
  they read from local Drift immediately (instant, offline-capable). Locally-recorded
  expenses appear in reports at once instead of waiting for a Supabase round-trip.
  Web retains remote-only path.
- [x] **Bug 11 — NOT A BUG (working as designed)**: Reports exclude voided sales
  everywhere — `status == 'completed'` filter in all four paths
  (`reportSalesProvider` remote line 131 + local line 171; `reportSummaryProvider`
  remote line 290 + local line 426). Temesgen's pre-update sales were voided during
  void-feature testing, so they correctly don't appear in Reports. They DO show in
  the sales list (operational log, badged "Voided") and the summary number is
  correct (excludes them) — which also proves the download/sync worked and there is
  no missing-history problem. Confirm by checking one OLD non-voided sale appears in
  Reports for its date.

---

## Session 17 follow-ups

- [ ] **`security` branch — merge when ready.** Published, NOT merged. Trial
  (14 days) + 10-digit serial activation (per-key duration, no stacking, 7-day
  countdown banner) + remote per-shop block. Migrations 019/020 already applied
  live. Operator SQL for generating keys / blocking is in the session notes.
- [ ] **Verify on device:** partial-settlement shows all payment logs; voided
  credit drops out of all credit views (fixes are in but unverified on-device).
- [ ] **Local Drift cache encryption (SQLCipher)** — Supabase is encrypted in
  transit + at rest; on-device cache is plaintext. Defer past the pilot.
- [x] Email overdue/low-stock reminders to ALL configured `notification_email`
  rows — done (dispatch-notifications v5).

---

## Immediate / Next Session

- [x] Remove inventory mode toggle from Settings — done (session 7)
- [x] Watch `seedNotifierProvider` in `dashboard_screen.dart` — done (session 7)
- [x] Credits tab with per-bill settlement — done (session 11)
- [x] Sales list color-coding (cash / unsettled credit / settled credit / voided) — done (session 11)
- [x] SaleDetailScreen: transaction ref, customer info, settlement notes — done (session 11)
- [x] Post-sale stale lists bug (Sales tab + Credits tab not refreshing) — done (session 11)
- [x] Fix `ListTile` ink splash invisible warnings — done (session 12)
- [x] Fix `RenderFlex` overflow by 13px in cart item row — done (session 12)
- [x] Staff invite 403 + duplicate email — done (session 12, Edge Function v4)
- [ ] "Gaps" view — surface products sold as `untracked` to prompt owner to add them to inventory

---

## Notifications Phase (branch: `feat/notifications`)

- [x] Email notifications for low stock — done (session 13, dispatch-notifications Edge Function)
- [x] Email notifications for overdue credits — done (session 13, manual trigger in Settings)
- [x] Settings screen: notification config (email, overdue days) — done (session 13)
- [x] `RESEND_API_KEY` set as Supabase secret (verified present, 36 chars) — done
- [x] Resend custom domain `massivedynamic.dev` wired into dispatch-notifications `from` — done
- [ ] Telegram notifications — deferred (revisit later)

### Scheduled low-stock notifications — DONE (server-side cron, replaces per-sale)
- [x] Enabled `pg_cron` + `pg_net` (migration 016).
- [x] Edge Function `cron-notifications` (verify_jwt:false; gated by Vault `cron_secret`
  via `public.verify_cron_secret` RPC). Loops ALL shops; recipients = owner auth email
  (DEFAULT) + optional `notification_email` shop_setting; sends via Resend from
  `notifications@massivedynamic.dev`. Verified end-to-end (200, email sent).
  - v2: sends ONE combined daily digest per shop — LOW STOCK section
    (inventory JOIN products where quantity <= low_stock_threshold) + OVERDUE CREDITS
    section (sales is_credit, not settled, completed, older than `overdue_credit_days`
    setting, default 7). Each section appears only if non-empty; no email if both empty.
- [x] Two pg_cron jobs: `low-stock-am` (`0 6 * * *`) and `low-stock-pm` (`0 18 * * *`)
  UTC = 9 AM & 9 PM EAT. They call the function via `net.http_post`, reading the
  `cron_secret` from Vault at run time.
- [x] App: removed per-sale `_checkLowStock` from `sales_provider.dart`; relabeled the
  Settings email field to "Additional notification email (optional)" (owner always notified).
- Owner email as default recipient also removed the old "no notification email" 400.
- Note: the old per-sale path (`dispatch-notifications` low_stock) is now unused but
  still deployed; the manual "Send overdue reminders" button still uses it.

---

## Planned — Re-add lint tools (blocked on upstream)

- [ ] Re-add `custom_lint` + `riverpod_lint` once `custom_lint 0.9+` resolves the `analyzer ^9.0.0` vs `^8.0.0` conflict with `riverpod_lint 3.x`. Check pub.dev before attempting.

---

## Phase 5 — Remaining

- [ ] Inventory writes write-through to Drift (product create/edit, stock add/correct)
- [ ] Expense writes offline (record expense when offline)
- [ ] Auto-trigger `SyncService.sync()` on connectivity restored
- [ ] Widget tests for key screens (NewSaleScreen, SalesScreen)

---

## Deferred / Manual Steps

- [ ] Supabase Dashboard: enable Leaked Password Protection (Auth → Settings → Password Security — cannot do via SQL)
- [ ] Android Setup (one-time, do before device testing):
  1. Android Studio → Settings → Android SDK → SDK Tools → check **"Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)"** → Apply
  2. `flutter doctor --android-licenses` (type y to each)
  3. `flutter doctor` — should show [√] Android toolchain
  4. Enable USB debugging on Android 10 phone → plug in → `flutter devices` → `flutter run --dart-define-from-file=config/env.json`
  5. Add `C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`, `C:\Users\Hp\.gradle`, `C:\Projects\SuqApp` to Windows Defender exclusions

---

## Security — Deferred (decide before wide rollout)

- [ ] Encrypt the local on-device Drift/SQLite cache (SQLCipher). Supabase is
  encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (AWS AES-256), but the offline copy
  on each phone is currently plaintext — exposed if a device is lost/stolen.
  Deferred for the initial debug-APK pilot; do before wider distribution.
  (Raised session 16 while shipping the GitHub Actions APK build.)

---

## Tech Debt (tracked, not urgent)

- Hardcoded strings in screens violate l10n rule. l10n is scaffolded but NOT
  adopted: `AppLocalizations.delegate` is not registered in `app.dart` and no
  screen uses it. Adopt l10n app-wide as one dedicated task — do not localize a
  single feature in isolation (it'd be the lone consumer + risk a runtime null).
- No error boundaries — raw Supabase exceptions reach snackbars
- Permission cache TTL not implemented (role changes need app restart)
- `Decimal.parse()` without try-catch in models — can throw on malformed DB data
- Inventory writes (create/edit product, stock adjust) not yet write-through to Drift
- Expenses & customers still push as one bulk upsert — a single invalid row blocks
  that batch. Sales / adjustments / credit payments already push per-row
  (failure-isolated); give expenses & customers the same treatment.
- First sales pull caps at 2000 most-recent rows (unsettled credits unbounded);
  older sales come via delta/on-demand. Fine for the pilot; revisit pagination
  for very high-volume shops.
- Presentation providers call Supabase directly (read queries + the stock-conflict
  claim/resolve in `conflicts_provider`), bypassing the "modules behind interfaces"
  rule. This is the existing pattern across `customers_provider`, `reports_provider`,
  `settings_provider`, etc. — a repository-layer extraction is an app-wide cleanup,
  not a per-feature change. (CodeRabbit CR#6/#7.)

---

## Data Backup & Recovery — Explore later

- [ ] **Device-level backup for offline data** (2026-06-18, session start): Users
  can restore their app data across uninstall via: (1) Supabase sync + login restore
  (already implemented, safest); (2) native device backup (iOS iCloud, Android backup
  service — minimal config); (3) manual export (CSV/JSON file). Explore which gives
  best UX offline, especially for unsynced local changes. Currently, uninstall loses
  local data if it hasn't synced to Supabase yet.

---

## Blocked / Deferred

- Chapa payments — out of scope v1
- Amharic l10n — translations not started
- Staff invite for existing Supabase users — Edge Function errors; users must use a fresh email
- Barcode scanning + product images — deferred post-v1
- Monetization / multi-branch pricing tiers — decision pending
- **Refunds / returns — DEFERRED (decided 2026-06-17)**. Void (same-day mistake,
  erases the sale) stays as-is. A refund (real sale, goods returned later — keeps
  the original sale, records cash out today, optionally restores stock, may be
  partial) is a distinct transaction type and deserves separate handling IF pilot
  shops actually process returns. Deferred for now. When built, must be
  offline-first from day one (do not repeat Bug 1).
